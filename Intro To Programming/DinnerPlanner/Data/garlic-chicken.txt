Ingredients:
0.25 cup olive oil
2 clove garlic
0.25 cup bread crumbs
0.25 cup Parmesan
4 - chicken breast

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Heat olive oil and garlic in a small saucepan over low heat until warmed, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer garlic and oil to a shallow bowl.
Combine bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in a separate shallow bowl.
Dip chicken breasts in the olive oil-garlic mixture using tongs; transfer to bread crumb mixture and turn to evenly coat. Transfer coated chicken to a shallow baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink and juices run clear, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
