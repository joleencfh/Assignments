Ingredients:
4 ounce linguine
2 - chicken breast
2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
2 tablespoon butter
1 - green bell pepper
0.5 - red bell pepper
4 - mushrooms
1 - scallion
1.5 cup heavy cream
2 dash basil
0.25 teaspoon lemon pepper
0.25 teaspoon salt
1 pinch garlic powder
1 dash black pepper
2 tablespoon Parmesan

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguini pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.
Meanwhile, place chicken and Cajun seasoning in a bowl, and toss to coat.
In a large skillet over medium heat, saute chicken in butter until no longer pink and juices run clear, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add green and red bell peppers, sliced mushrooms and green onions; cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat, and stir in heavy cream. Season the sauce with basil, lemon pepper, salt, garlic powder and ground black pepper, and heat through.
In a large bowl, toss linguini with sauce. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.
