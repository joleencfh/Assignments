Ingredients:
6 - pork chops
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon seasoning salt
2 - egg
0.25 cup flour
2 cup bread crumbs
4 tablespoon olive oil
10.75 ounce condensed cream of mushroom soup
0.5 cup milk
0.33 cup white wine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Rinse pork chops, pat dry, and season with garlic powder and seasoning salt to taste. Place the beaten eggs in a small bowl. Dredge the pork chops lightly in flour, dip in the egg, and coat liberally with bread crumbs.
Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the pork chops 5 minutes per side, or until the breading appears well browned. Transfer the chops to a 9x13 inch baking dish, and cover with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. While baking, combine the cream of mushroom soup, milk and white wine in a medium bowl. After the pork chops have baked for an hour, cover them with the soup mixture. Replace foil, and bake for another 30 minutes.
