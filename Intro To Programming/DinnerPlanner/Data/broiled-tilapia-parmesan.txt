Ingredients:
0.5 cup Parmesan
0.25 cup butter
3 tablespoon mayonnaise
2 tablespoon lemon juice
2 dash basil
2 dash black pepper
1 pinch onion powder
1 pinch celery salt
2 pound tilapia fillets

Directions:
Preheat your oven's broiler. Grease a broiling pan or line pan with aluminum foil.
In a small bowl, mix together the Parmesan cheese, butter, mayonnaise and lemon juice. Season with dried basil, pepper, onion powder and celery salt. Mix well and set aside.
Arrange fillets in a single layer on the prepared pan. Broil a few inches from the heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the fillets over and broil for a couple more minutes. Remove the fillets from the oven and cover them with the Parmesan cheese mixture on the top side. Broil for 2 more minutes or until the topping is browned and fish flakes easily with a fork. Be careful not to over cook the fish.
